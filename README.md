Research Track 2 - Continuous Assessment
================================
The following repository contains the links directed towards the individual assignments covered during
the Research Track 2 course of the Robotics Master programme at the University of Genova, Italy.
<br><br>

Assignment 1
----------------------
Contains the amended repository of the second assignment for the Research Track 1 course, in which students
were required to create documentation for their code using either Doxygen or Spinx. The Doxygen files can
be found in the newly created 'docs' folder. To view the documentation on the browser, head towards the
'Code Documentation' section of the README and click on the link.<br>

Assignment 2
----------------------
Contains the solution to the second assignment. As part of the assignment, students were required to create a user interface using Python on Jupyter Notebook, that interacts with a Gazebo based robot. The implemented user interface should be capable of allowing a target to be set and cancelled. Besides the UI, the robot and target positions were to be plotted, and the number of reached and cancelled targets graphed.<br>

Assignment 3
----------------------
Contains the solution to the third assignment. Students were required to compare the performance of the python scripts they had created using the Python Robotics Simulator with those of their peers on a certain parameter, and write a report summarising the process and results.<br>
